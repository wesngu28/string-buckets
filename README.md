## Motivation

Often, I encounter disorganized lists of strings. These lists can stem from various sources, such as tasks I need to complete or items of interest that I've lost track of. Manually sorting these lists can become tedious, so I decided to create a graphical user interface to make this less boring and also learn how to implement drag-and-drop functionality.
